<h1>Final Project</h1>
<p>For my final project I made a awesome box that incorporated 4 processes. The first process was cutting and gluing together the wood. The second process was designing and printing out the stickers. The third process was designing and laser engraving on the wood. And the fourth process was spray painting the wood. This box is very versatile as it is nice to look at and it can hold things. I am very proud of my box. Have a good summer Mr. Gerber. </p>
