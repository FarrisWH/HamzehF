	<h3>About Bob's Butter's</h3>
	<p>Founded in 1983 by Bob Bulcher, Bob's Butters is a shop that sells only the most premium select butters. Our patrons have come to crave Bob's wonderful butter and worship his talent. This love of Bob has gotten to the point where  people nominated him for the 2016 presidential elections and Bob won 8.25% of the popular vote, carrying Oklahoma.</p>
	<p>Butter has long been relegated to be a mere spread for toast or used in place of oil when cooking. However here at Bob's Butters, we firmly believe in the versatility of butter and its ability to fill the role of main course. We have come up with many different ways to prepare and consume butter; deep fried butter and butter sushi being just a few examples.</p>
