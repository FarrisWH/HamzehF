<h1>Farris' Digital Engineering and Fabrication Website</h1>
<p>About me: My name is Farris and I am a junior in high school in Ohio. I have lived in Ohio most for the large majority of my life but was born in Texas. Some of my hobbies include video games, cooking, netflix, eating, and hanging out with my friends. I also have played soccer for 13 years soccer and this year I was the JV captain for my school team. My favorite subjects are English and History. I enjoy learning about and analyzing history. Reading and writing essays about works of literature are also some of my things we have to do in school.   </p>
